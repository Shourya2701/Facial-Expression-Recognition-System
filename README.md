# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System

Facial expressions are the visible manifestation of the affective state, cognitive activity, intention, personality and psychopathology of a person and plays a communicative role in interpersonal relations. Automatic recognition of facial expressions can be an important component of natural human-machine interfaces; it may also be used in behavioural science and in clinical practice. An automatic Facial Expression Recognition system needs to perform detection and location of faces in a cluttered scene, facial feature extraction, and facial expression classification. Facial expression recognition system is implemented using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). CNN model of the project is based on LeNet Architecture. Kaggle facial expression dataset with seven facial expression labels as happy, sad, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral is used in this project.
